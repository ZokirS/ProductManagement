# Product Management API

This API is part of the Product Management system, providing endpoints for managing products, including retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting products. The API uses role-based authorization to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- A configured and running SQL Server database (or an in-memory database for testing)
- Visual Studio 2022 (or later) or any other preferred IDE

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProductManagementAPI.git
   cd ProductManagementAPI
   ```

2. **Restore Packages**

   Navigate to the project directory and restore the NuGet packages:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Configure the Database**

   Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` with your database details.

   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "YourConnectionStringHere"
   }
   ```

4. **Run Migrations**

   Apply the migrations to create the necessary database tables:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

## Role-Based Authorization

The API uses a custom attribute `AuthorizeRole` to enforce role-based authorization. The roles supported are:

- `Admin` - Full access to all endpoints (CRUD operations).
- `User` - Read-only access to products.

### **Custom Filter Attributes**

The API uses a custom filter attribute, `AuthorizeRole`, to handle role-based access control:

- **`[AuthorizeRole(UserRole.Admin, UserRole.User)]`** - Allows access to both Admin and User roles.
- **`[AuthorizeRole(UserRole.Admin)]`** - Restricts access to Admin role only.

## Services

### **IProductService**

The `IProductService` interface defines methods for product-related operations:

- `Task<ProductVAT> GetProductByIdAsync(long id);`
- `Task<List<ProductVAT>> GetProductsAsync();`
- `Task<Product> AddProductAsync(long userId, ProductAddRequest request);`
- `Task<Product> UpdateProductAsync(long userId, ProductUpdateRequest request);`
- `Task<Product> DeleteProductAsync(long userId, long id);`

### **Models**

- **`ProductAddRequest`** - Model for adding a new product.
- **`ProductUpdateRequest`** - Model for updating an existing product.
- **`ProductVAT`** - Model for product details including VAT.

## Running the Application

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

You can now use tools like Postman or Swagger (if configured) to interact with the API.
